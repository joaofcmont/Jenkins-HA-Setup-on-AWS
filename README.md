# For this Jenkins HA project, I have used the following DevOps Tools :

1)    GitHub: Repository to store IaC
2)    Packer: To build Jenkins Controller and agent AMIs
3)    Ansible: To configure Jenkins controller and agent during the AMI building process
4)    Terraform: To provision AWS resources
5)    Python Boto3: To retrieve SSH public key from AWS parameter store.
